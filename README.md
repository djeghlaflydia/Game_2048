# 2048 Unity Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my first project created with Unity! This is a clone of the popular 2048 puzzle game. I developed this project to learn more about game development using Unity, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## How to Play
2048 is a simple and addictive puzzle game. Here are the instructions on how to play:

1. **Objective**: Combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.
2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles on the board.
   - When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one, doubling the number.

3. **Winning**: The game is won when you create a tile with the number 2048.
4. **Losing**: The game is lost if there are no more possible moves.
